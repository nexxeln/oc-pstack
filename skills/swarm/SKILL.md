# Swarm

Fan out N parallel background workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a `pstack_todo` list with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not a concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` role in `pstack_roles`. The user chose it for pstack, so passing it is an explicit model request. For `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If the `subagent` tool rejects it, use the closest model of the same family from `opencode.models` and say so. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with the `subagent` tool, `agent: "general"`, `background: true`, and the step 4 model, left unset for `inherit-parent`. A worker that writes gets its own worktree (`rift.create` when available, otherwise `git worktree add`), named in its brief.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, create its worktree at that branch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it. OpenCode limits nesting with `experimental.subagent_depth` (default 1), so a delegate may be unable to spawn its own subagents. On a depth error, run that fan-out from the parent session and say so.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
